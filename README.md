- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SyntheticAce, but just call me Ace. Right now I am doing my computer science BSc program at my local university.
- My goal at the moment is learning more about programming and doing smaller projects and challenges, with which I can refine my skills.
- So far I have worked with C, C#, C++, Haskell, Erlang, Java and Python, and I am looking forward to extending my knowledge about these languages, while also learning new ones.
