- 👋My name is Ákos, and I am student of Eötvös Loránd University. Right now I am studying computer science in the bachelor program.
- My main interests are computer graphics and game development. You will mainly see projects in these areas on my profile.
- My goal at the moment is learning more about programming and doing smaller projects and challenges, with which I can refine my skills.
